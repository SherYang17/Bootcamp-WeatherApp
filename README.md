### Overview
 

You will be creating a weather app that will give you real-time weather data. This assignment will involve you using the Open Weather API. The purpose of this assignment is for you to learn how to connect to an API and how to manipulate the data so that you can display real-time data on a web page.

 

You can go to:

Open Weather APILinks to an external site.

 

You will need to create an account with an email so that you can get your own API key. If you share keys, it might penalize you for making too many calls with the same key.

 

It is recommended that you use the 'One Call API' to get the data you need to complete this assignment. The call looks something like this:

 

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&exclude={part}&appid={API key}
Links to an external site.
 

One of the requirements is to get the user's zip code to get the weather data. However, the example above is getting the data by lat (latitude) and lon (longitude) which are coordinates. Part of the challenge will be to figure out OpenWeather's documentation. To save you some time, check out this link to help you figure out how to get data by zip:

 

https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-apiLinks to an external site.

 

 

This will test your ability to use JavaScript to manipulate data from an API. This will pull together all of the items we have learned so far such as DOM manipulations, functions, making basic web pages, etc. This will also challenge you on some of the essential skills of any developer like debugging, reading API documentation, trial and error, and thinking through the user experience.

 

Requirements
To count as completing this assignment, you will need to at least complete the base requirements. If you are planning to attempt the other requirements, read them all first so that you can better plan how you are going to set up your page and code. Be mindful of your time, if you attempt the other requirements but do not complete the basics, you will not get points for completion.

 

Base Requirements
You must create a website with the following items:

- A page with a heading and sections separating your content

- The page must be styled either using a CSS framework or your own custom CSS

- You must make an API call to the service and get the weather data

- You must accept input from the user asking for the zip code they would like the weather of

- You must display the following data points on the page from the API:

    Current Date, City from the zipcode, Current temperature in Fahrenheit , current conditions, Temp Hi/Lo

- Host using GitHub Pages

 

Moderate Requirements (optional)
All of the previous requirements plus:

- Add a few more data points to the page if available such as temp feels like and humidity

- A part of the page that neatly displays the forecast for the next 3 days. Display the condition and hi/lo temp

- You must use Icons from a common library to improve your visual display

- You must have another input field that asks the user for their city and state and get the weather data using that

- Make your app responsive (i.e. looks good on mobile and desktop)

- You must have a button somewhere that converts the temperature from ferinheight to celsius (feel free to look up the conversion formula)

 

Advanced Requirements (optional)
All of the previous requirements plus:

- Adding a third input that uses the Google Geolocation API and asks the user for their current location
- A color scheme that changes depending on the current weather conditions

- Add at least two instances of animation of your choice anywhere on the page

- Host the website on your own Heroku app

 

 

Please upload your project to GitHub Pages link and Repo link to your project for submission.
